# 20210816165907 - Done with OSTEP

Finally done with some of OSTEP, as far as 356 syllabus goes to. Took a minute and a half had a lot of 
off days and maybe a week or two of complete burnout from the subject itself. Wow what a phenomenal
book. Phenomenal stuff to learn and so much it offers after the fact for people to keep learning.

Surprisingly never read through an entire book like I did OSTEP. What a book to go through!!
