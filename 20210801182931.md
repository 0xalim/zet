# 20210801182931 - Youtube Search API

Well I just spent half my day working on an automated system to lookup youtube videos and autoplay them on mpv. I had to learn a bit of jquery, how curl works
and most importantly how Youtube Search API works on google developer console. It was super fun while it lasted but as i've learnt the hard way, API call's are not
always free... I tried to get a search result of 1000 videos to see how fast it could curl it. When I opened the file i directed all output to it was only about
50 videos. Thought oh maybe there are different pages I need to specify in the url or something.  I tried running curl manually to debug an stdin error of:

```
jq: error (at <stdin>:13): Cannot iterate over null (null)
```

After the manual curl this was the output... 

```JSON
{
  "error": {
    "code": 403,
    "message": "The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your \u003ca href=\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\"\u003equota\u003c/a\u003e.",
    "errors": [
      {
        "message": "The request cannot be completed because you have exceeded your \u003ca href=\"/youtube/v3/getting-started#quota\"\u003equota\u003c/a\u003e.",
        "domain": "youtube.quota",
        "reason": "quotaExceeded"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Man I was bummed. How ridiculous of me to think that API calls especially from evil corporate giants like google would be free??
I'll have a look on github to see if I can figure this out sooner or later. I'm exhuasted, feels like I've run a marathon. And back...
