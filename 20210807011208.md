# 20210807011208 - Meltdown and Spectre

Just finished chapter 23(?) of ostep. Oh my god what a section! I loved learning about VMS and VAX systems
back in the days. I absolutely adore Linux systems, so obviously I had a blast learning about them too. 
Not sure if other architectures are much different, we covered intel x86. Little about AMD's nO eXec
bit `NX`. 

The section I absolutely loved the most, was obviously the security section. The title first was buffer
overflow, so I thought oh here we go another chapter about buffer overflow from the 300th computer science
book what a surprise. But it went on to explain how you get RCE from buffer overflow exploits, what
fix developer created (nO eXec). Moved on to return-oriented programming `ROP` where return addresses
were changed in the functions return. Which they thought was absolutely amazing, me too. How ASLR was
introduced because of ROP, and how KASLR became a thing due to how good of a mechanism it was. 

Lastly all hell broke loose when they mentioned meltdown and spectre. Never heard of them so I thought,
hmm maybe some small random issue in the kernel? Nope, turned out to be (at the time) computer fundamental
breaking news. They mentioned spectre (more problematic of the 2), how speculative execution worked in CPU's.
How traces of information were left in CPU cache, and how this information could be read. A fix was 
mentioned, however it was a bandaid fix as it would slow the computer down by 1000x. How the fundamental
kernel address space had to be changed, only the bare minimum in every process rather than all of it. And,
so we have to create a kernel page table isolation thing, where it was used to protect kernel even more
by only being used while called into kernel.

This was intense stuff man, I fucking loved it so much. Now I'm super excited at time 2121PM about this
stuff, wow. I'll leave the link down there for meltdown and spectre. I really want to read those papers
later on in life when I can actually understand the thing. Writers of ostep said needing to take a more
advanced course on this was necessary, and a bit of understanding on speculative execution for example
was necessary (likely).

I'll leave this quote as well that absolutely blew my mind at the end. What a read.

***We encourage you to read them on your own, as we can only provide the
merest drop from what is an ocean of complexity. But, you've got to start
somewhere. What is any ocean, but a multitude of drops?***
