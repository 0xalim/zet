# 20210812025319 - Starting Out Simple

Just finished one of the chapters in ostep, locks in data structures (concurrent). And, again they've provided a quote that I could not agree more with. This
idea of premature optimization, that `it is the root of all evil.` as stated by Knuth's Law. One should develop a solution via the most simple way. And then
when performance is needed, we start going about bettering the performance and changing positions of locks instead of doing it from the get go.

One should develop things freshly very simply, and when needed should optimize for better performance when needed. Remember, premature optimization is the root
of all evil!
