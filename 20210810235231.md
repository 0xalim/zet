# 20210810235231 - 60's

Yet again another piece of evidence has fallen into my lap that has proven that old things are still good. Was going through the locks chapter in ostep
just now and have seen an implementation of locking that is a hybrid approach. It's called `Dahm Locks`, nowadays called two-phase locks guess for no
other reason but to sound less cooler? How cool does Dahm Lock sound, eh?

Anyways, this approach dates back to the 60's and is used in some architectures. As time keeps ticking, the more I realize how further we are going from
the time these things were developed. Old computers, old approaches, old thinking may actually be better than newer thinking. I've got a good quote that
I have written down in my notes. Was also in the ostep book.

*"Some ideas, even those that are 50 years old, are still worth knowing,
a thought that is well known to those in most other fields (e.g Physics),
but has to be stated in technology-driven disciplines."*

This quote has applied generally a lot these days. Wonder if this is what growing up feels like? If I could I would have always told kids to get off the lawn
so not sure if *growing up* really is the cause.
