# 20210926031703 - Tired

I woke up god knows when today, and from the moment I woke up i've been entranced
in completing Assignment 1 for 474. Not sure why but I want to do well. I want to
complete this well and quick. But I don't get bored that fast somehow? I keep going
and going, I might spend an hour or so, who knows the time isn't even a matter it
feels like while I was working on this. Its the first time in life where I feel
completely overtaken by work, I was able to work from when I woke up till a couple
hours before sleep. I would work, go to bed for a bit then wake up and continue. I
noticed that this was happening to me when I would shut off my laptop to take myself
away for a minute for a think. And then not even 5 minutes later would have an idea
on how to potentially fix a problem. Now i'm completely stuck and thinking I need to
ask the professor for some help. But I very much expect tomorrow to be the same thing
to some extent? Not sure why, was it the pseudo break I took the day before where I 
slept essentially the moment I came home? I am not sure. What a weird feeling. This
may be the start of something insane, or is just some sort of luck today that I can
keep going without feeling stressed or tired.
