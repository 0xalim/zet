# 20210820030617 - Certs

Was on the edge about this topic for a long time, but to
be honest theres absolutely no reason not to get certs
if i can afford it. So we'll push for the trifecta first:

1. Sec+
2. Network+
3. A+

Theres probably a better pathing for this trifecta but it
doesn't matter to me that much. I'll not really give myself
much of a time limit just to chill out on burnout and stress.
Taking a harder semester than usual, but I've completed
opsys so that'll make things easier. Thinking of dropping
the creds to 14 from 17 still just to make sure we can get
these certs for sure. In no situation do i wanna retake
any of these exams at all!

I'm excited, it'll be something new and more industrialized
than usual, which I'm typically not a fan of but we have to
push for some stuff, and this gives a better concrete
rewards... the `certs` !

Good luck to me, August 19 is my starting date lets see how
long it'll take me to get my first cert.
