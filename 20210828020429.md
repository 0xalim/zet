# 20210828020429 - Seed Ubuntu

The vm we use for 474 is from SeedUbuntu, and the labs i'm guessing are the ones from
SeedUbuntu labs website. All of this is an assumption, but a pretty good one :D I do not
believe professors from this univeristy really have the time/effort or want to develop
something like this from the ground up.

Saying this, i've also just remembered perugini developed an entire course for cps356
funded by some organization or something, working with a couple other professors I think
from write state. Oh Well, my opinion still stands!

All this just to remind myself to complete all SeedUbuntu labs before we actually do them
in the proper labs. I wanna get it out of the way asap. This is the vibe of this semester
really. I want to complete everything asap so i could work on sec+ and do some hacking.
Not gonna lie, a lot of subjects are not really that interesting. Computer engineering is
a boring major to say the very least. Engineering courses are dead boring, always knew
electrical engineering courses are just not for someone like me :D If anyone is reading
this and is considering doing an engineering course, dont! Everything you want to learn
you can do so just from google!

Oh how wonderful my only real friend, google, is. Contains all information i want in a
fraction of second. Anyways, past the narcissim(?) engineering course never was for me.
I always liked computer science from day 1. There is no point in bitching about it, i
don't belong in this society that peopple have built themselves for. I cannot sit here
with a fake smile while acknowledging all the terrible horrendous things happening around
me. A bit off topic - but this is necessary as all other people have done the same :D
