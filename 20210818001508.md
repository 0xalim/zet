# 20210818001508 - Bounds

Was reading about the fence-post error on wikipedia when I 
saw a Dijkstra reference. Obviously I clicked on it just to
see what it was about, curious about Dijkstra nowadays eh.
The publication number was EWD831. It talks about many things
more but I havn't gotten to the end yet before wanting to
write this zettel. When writing bounds it's best to use the
notation like this:
  
```
          >= n  x  < n+x
```

* The lower bounds should be less than or equals.
* The upper bounds should be less than

He mentioned the programming language `Mesa` for XEROX
which i also learned during ostep. That Mesa had
multiple notations of writing something like example
shown above. And that it was a source of clumsiness. So
from now on, if I can conform to the standard shown
above then i would like to.
