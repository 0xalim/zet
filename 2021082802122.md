# 20210828021224 - Work structure

Thinking about this for a while now and there is no way to go around things at all.
Work has to be put in and done, so do i'll get everything done in the weekends in
regards to studying for weeks worth of content, while dumping all my time into 601,
assignments, reviews and hacking!

Fuck wasting time studying stuff i don't find interesting, noone should ever do this
even if god begged them to. Do what you want, the consequences are existent but they
are ones that you must deal with because you did what you enjoyed. Unless obviously
you are doing something extremely wrong :S Otherwise, if you ain't hurting yourself or
others, then do it! And only do that 1 thing until you are the `Ken Thompson` of that
thing!
