# Personal Zettelkasten 

### *What is a zettelkasten* you ask?

Well zettelkasten is german for *'Slip Box'* and it's essentially a centralized environment, that should be within hands reach, for all your notes. Whether
they are for writing scientific papers, quick mind notes, or just things that you've learnt throughout the day. The Idea is that your brain is the CPU, all
processing should be done there. And since I can't virtualize my brain I essentially can only do 1 thing at once. So storing all your information would make sense
no? My brain is for processing not storing information! My zettelkasten is my centralized information system (file system) to keep everything in.

### What's with these weird file names?

These names are generated by a small script inspired by [rwxrob](https://github.com/rwxrob) called isosec. It's essentially a number generator that is based on the year,  month,day and second of the time I worked on said file. So all my files will not collide at all and everything should be neatly organized. Because we live in the digitalworld, I try to keep things digital as much as possible to help me from the headache of physical objects. Who could carry an entire slip box that weights over a ton (and increases everyday!) everywhere they go?! I'd rather keep things on a small 100g phone that is 100% of the time being tapped by the government and all the companies that would want my information :)
