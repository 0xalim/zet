First time doing a competition, and it's one that is related to school. Lots of pressure, but super fun. Spent literally
all my time doing gym for a couple of days, I wake up thinking about hacking and completing the gym, go to sleep thinking
about the gym. Really pushing for top 25 in the individual league; preseason is a week long effort so will push for that
in 2 days to see how I would do under time limit and pressure. Team game will be more of a fun one, working with other
people, helping them learn while also learning myself. Definitely aiming for good score in individual season mostly. Not
sure how teaming will go, should have a kickoff this coming week. I've already finished the gym as of writing this zettel
by atleast 24 hours, most people who have accepted Dr. Phu's invitation have yet to complete the gym other than me, is it
slightly worrying? Maybe, but i'd rather people take their time and enjoy it. Will have another zettel by before and after
preseason, individual and maybe team games later on. This is going to be super fun :D
