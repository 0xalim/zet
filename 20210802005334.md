# 20210802005334 - ytfzf

Ytfzf stands for youtube fzf, where fzf is fuzzy finder. It's a posix compliant terminal script that allows me to search up youtube videos! As I have previously 
expressed my anger with the youtube api search, I needed a method to query youtube for videos without the use of their api. Ytfzf was an option I stumbled
upon on github while perusing around. It uses fzf to fuzz for youtube results, mpv as the media player (perfect as I initially wanted this), and jq for parsing
json files. This literally was almost the same set of dependancies I was using to create my own!

Search results are not the best, as to be expected but their fine. Pseudo playlists can be created by applying for multiple videos to be played one after the other,
and thumbnails can be shown on the terminal. How unexpected is that? It uses ueberzug to do that. Have a look:

I'll need to read over their script (over 1k lines) to see best practices, how they do it, how they parse json files using jq (which was annoying today), and 
the method of using terminal split like that. Lots of stuff to learn here. Great since I've been wanting to learn `posix shell`!
