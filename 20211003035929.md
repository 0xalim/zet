# 20211003035929 - Documentary

Was watching a documentary somewhere on the internet about some old school
hackers... You know the casual thing you do on a Sunday night when dying
of boredom! While ago I had read a [Phrack Issue](http://phrack.org/issues/49/14.html)
by Aleph_One. The release date of this issue was 1996 which blows my mind
at how ahead of the game these guys were, people like aleph_one are those who
invent the game; this guy wrote a complete issue on something as tedious and
extremely-granular as buffer overflows.

Back in 1996, pretty sure everyone has heard of the stories of so called 
'hackers' defacing websites and ddosing domains. No doubt these types of
attacks are not easy to do (albeit people wrote tools to automate some 
of the security disclosures, SATAN for example) but people were not really
looking at the big picture. Aleph_One recognized that something like buffer
overflows could be used to further lead to some bigger exploits like arbitrary
code execution. Back in those days, all people wanted to do was ddos some
domains and put some **edgy** pictures on CIA and FBI webpages 8]. Aleph_one
wrote an entire issue on how to change return address in memory and such.

Anyways, this is getting long for no reason i forgot the main reason of why
i was writing this zet. I saw aleph_one in this documentary after i'd read
the phrack issue and was amazed at the coincidence that i saw a random
documentary and found this guy on there! Initially I had titled this zet
Aleph_One but looking at it now, they deserve an entire zet (or page) about
how cool they are. Yes I write page... thinking of creating a website for all
my stuff to go on there 8] We'll see how that goes though, I've got so much
cool stuff i want to do every single day but there just isn't enough hours
in the day!
