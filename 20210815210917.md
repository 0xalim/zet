# 20210815210917 - Hills Law

Hill's law states that something simple and dumb can be the better choice. Hill was writing a dissertation on CPU caching, and found that direct-mapping
is better than set associative. Due to having faster lookups. I also just read how read/writer locks sound cool, but they are complex and often have too much
overhead. Thus it is better to use simple and dumb things first and move from there onwards!
