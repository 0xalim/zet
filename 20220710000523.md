# Most Beautiful Names ?

## PSEXEC

Some people might be inclined to think I mean a person's name, but who decided
that had to be the case? While completing the last room of TryHackMe's Jr
Penetation Tester's path (Windows Priv. Esc.) one of the tools we had to use
is pcexec which is one of the binaries that come with impacket.

Impacket is an amazing collection(?) of python scripts all related to hacking,
infosec, or whatever you want to call it. It does other thing's but I've seen
it mainly used for escalation in Windows Box's, stuff that deals with SMB,
Kerberos, and in this privilege escalation via sam/system hives and abuse of
backup privileges on low privilege accounts.

I've never seen this attack surface being used ever, so it's cool that I'm
learning really amazing stuff but what caught my attention was the name of the
python script `pcexec` which is fairly similar to psexec, the windows tool that
lets you execute stuff. The name psexec is probably one of my favorite sounding
names ever??

When it comes to human names perhaps it's different, but who cares for that now?

## OISF

On a side note, attending OISF Annual Conference - the sweet 16th birthday was
phenomenal. Really cool stuff being talked about, cool people in general, lots
of fun during the presentations. Especially the IR Superstar talk... Wow Matt
is an amazing person and presenter, loved the superstar outfit. Phu had a great
talk too, and amazing aspirations that he talked about. Wonder if I'll ever be
around later down the road to see some of his stuff starting to take fruition?
